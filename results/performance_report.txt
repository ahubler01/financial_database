Strategy Overview:
The strategy uses a LightGBM classifier to predict the direction of next-minute returns.
Trades are executed when the model's probability exceeds predefined thresholds:
- Long positions when p̂(y=+1) > 0.62
- Short positions when p̂(y=+1) < 0.38
- Flat otherwise

Position sizing is volatility-scaled to target 1% annual volatility.
The strategy includes 0.5bp slippage per round-trip trade.
